    As of 15.01.2016 â†’ I cannot create new note for today

*** Shutdown option to offer to unmount the data directory

*** Fix interface

**  Change configuration from config.ini to Python or YAML

*   Put it on Github

*   Remove un-needed files

*   Remove useless commented out print() statements.


Done or resolved:

--- Startup check for presence of data directory and option to mount it
    On Mac this should check for the existence of the .img file and
    then ask if I want to have it mounted.
    ==> 25.02.2016 Finally I decided that it was best to remove the mounting part
    from Yaemrs. The program just points to the directory with the data, that's it.
    Mounting and securing the data will not be part of it for now because it's too variable
    from Mac to Linux.
